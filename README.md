# Advent of Code 2024

In this repository I share my solutions for Advent of Code 2024 tasks. The solutions were created in Java using JDK version 21.

## Structure

Each task has its separate folder named `Day{number}`. In the folder you can find my solution as well as a README containing
the task description and expected outcomes.

## Running the code

I recommend using IntelliJ IDEA (version 2024.3 at the time of writing this README) with JDK 21. To run the code from
a particular day go to the main class and press `CTRL`+`SHIFT`+`F10`.
